Hey guys, this is just my small project for training programming in OOP. I have some plans how to upgrade it and also few things i would like to change / fix.
1. I need to fix method showBill, because lets say on table were multiple peaople. So after 1st customer the bill doesnt count together with another person. So basically its
1 bill per 1 person.
2. Another thing i would like to add an option for example didnt have soup and drink.
3. and for last part i want to add Waiter's accounts and apply log in option.
